#Introduction
This specification is intended to provide a complete and concise
definition of the syntax and semantics of the Hack language, suitable for
use by the following:

-   Implementers of a Hack compiler
-   Implementers of a test suite for the Hack language
-   Programmers writing Hack code

For now, the runtime library has been excluded, as that is documented at
[docs.hhvm.com](http://docs.hhvm.com). As such, all forward references to library facilities have placeholders of the form (Â§xx).
